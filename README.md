###### Overview

Website optimization project as part of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884). 
The goal was to optimize a provided website for it achieves a target PageSpeed score and runs at 60 frames per second.

###### Optimizations to reach a pagespeed score of 90 or higher for mobile and desktop

* Added media attribute for css
* Inline a css file
* Purified css to eliminate unneeded css
* Minified css, html and js files
* Loaded google-analytics and google fonts javascript asynchronously
* Optimized images using grunt plugin

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in view/js/main.js and pizza.html

###### Optimizations to reach frames per second of 60 or higher

* Updated the function `updatePositions` to [avoid layout thrashing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing#avoid-layout-thrashing)
* The function `changePizzaSizes` was updated to only calculate the variable for the first pizza

# Project Instructions
## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.
